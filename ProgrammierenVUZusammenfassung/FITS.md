FITS (Flexible Image Transport System): seit 1981 der Astronomen liebstes Format: from astropy.io import fits

![[Pasted image 20240505214902.png]]**Flexible Image Transport System** (**FITS**) is an [open standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard") defining a digital [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format "File format") useful for storage, transmission and processing of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (for example a 2D image), or tables. FITS is the most commonly used digital [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format "File format") in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"). The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing [photometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics) "Photometry (optics)") and spatial calibration information, together with image origin metadata.

The FITS format was first standardized in 1981; it has evolved gradually since then, and the most recent version (4.0) was standardized in 2016. FITS was designed with an eye towards long-term archival storage, and the maxim _once FITS, always FITS_ represents the requirement that developments to the format must be [backward compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatible "Backward compatible").

[Image metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_metadata "Image metadata") is stored in a human-readable [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") header. The information in this header is designed to calculate the byte offset of some information in the subsequent data unit to support direct access to the data cells. Each FITS file consists of one or more headers containing ASCII [card images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_image "Card image") (80 character fixed-length strings) that carry keyword/value pairs, interleaved between data blocks. The keyword/value pairs provide information such as size, origin, coordinates, binary data format, free-form comments, history of the data, and anything else the creator desires: while many keywords are reserved for FITS use, the standard allows arbitrary use of the rest of the name-space.

FITS is also often used to store non-image data, such as [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"), [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") lists, [data cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube "Data cube"), or [structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data "Structured data") such as multi-table [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database"). A FITS file may contain several extensions, and each of these may contain a data object. For example, it is possible to store [x-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") and [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") exposures in the same file.
