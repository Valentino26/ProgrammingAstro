**Comma-separated values** (**CSV**) is a [text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file "Text file") format that uses [commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma") to separate values, and [newlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline "Newline") to separate records. A CSV file stores [tabular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information) "Table (information)") data (numbers and text) in [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text"), where each line of the file typically represents one data [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) "Record (computer science)"). Each record consists of the same number of [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science) "Field (computer science)"), and these are separated by commas in the CSV file. If the field delimiter itself may appear within a field, fields can be surrounded with quotation marks.

The CSV file format is one type of [delimiter-separated file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values "Delimiter-separated values").Delimiters frequently used include the comma, [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values "Tab-separated values"), space, and semicolon. Delimiter-separated files are often given a ".csv" [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension "Filename extension") even when the field separator is not a comma. Many applications or libraries that consume or produce CSV files have options to specify an alternative delimiter.

The lack of adherence to the CSV standard RFC 4180 necessitates the support for a variety of CSV formats in data input software. Despite this drawback, CSV remains widespread in data applications and is widely supported by a variety of software, including common spreadsheet applications such as [Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel "Microsoft Excel") Benefits cited in favor of CSV include human readability and the simplicity of the format.
